          <h3>The Problem</h3>
          <p>
            The chocolate supply chain isn't fair for everyone. It begins with
            many farmers who grow cocoa and ends with lots of people who love
            chocolate. But what happens in between? Only a few big chocolate
            companies control that part. They make a lot of money by paying
            farmers very little for their cocoa. This makes life really hard for
            the farmers, and some even have to use child labor or become slaves.

          <h3>What?! Modern Slaver?</h3>
          <p>
            Slavery continues to be a troubling issue on cocoa farms in West
            Africa due to the unequal distribution of resources. However, Tony's
            Chocolonely is committed to bringing about change and putting an end
            to this injustice. They believe that everyone deserves to be treated
            fairly and that no one should be forced into labor or slavery.

          <p>
            Our goal is to have all chocolate in the world be 100% free from
            slavery. It's not just about our chocolate, but all chocolate
            everywhere. How are we going to make that happen? It's going to be
            challenging and there are many things to consider. But with the help
            of Tony's roadmap, we have a plan. The roadmap has three important
            pillars that will guide us towards achieving our goal of having 100%
            slave-free chocolate.

          <h3>Tony's 5 Sourcing Principles for slave-free cocoa</h3>
          <p>
            We believe that chocolate can be made in a better way, and we lead
            by example with our incredibly delicious chocolate. We show the
            world that it's possible to make chocolate without using slaves. By
            following Tony's Sourcing Principles for cocoa, we ensure that our
            chocolate is free from slavery. And the best part is, we can still
            be successful as a business while making slave-free chocolate.

          <p>
            We know that we can't achieve our goal alone. While we are committed
            to making slave-free chocolate, we need everyone to join us in this
            mission. It's a collective effort, and we all need to roll up our
            sleeves and take action. So, what can you do to help? Share our
            story, raise awareness about the issue of slavery in the chocolate
            industry, and support companies that prioritize slave-free cocoa.
            Together, we can create a significant impact and make slave-free
            chocolate the norm.
